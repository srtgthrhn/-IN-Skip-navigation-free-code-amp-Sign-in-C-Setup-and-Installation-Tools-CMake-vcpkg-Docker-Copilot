## Getting Started

Follow our comprehensive environment setup guide below to get started with modern C++ development across any platform.

# C++23 Masterclass Development Environment Setup

Quick Setup Links:
- [Windows Setup Guide](#windows-setup)
- [Linux Setup Guide](#linux-setup-ubuntu-2404)
- [macOS Setup Guide](#macos-setup)
- [Docker Setup Guide](#docker-setup-alternative-for-any-platform) (Recommended for consistent environment)

This guide explains how to set up your development environment for the C++23 Masterclass course across different platforms.

> üê≥ **Why Docker?** Using Docker provides a consistent, pre-configured environment that works identically across all platforms. It eliminates "works on my machine" issues and gives you instant access to the latest C++ tools without complex setup. Perfect for both beginners and professionals!

## Common Requirements

All platforms require these core tools:

   ```

   The container includes:
   - GCC 14.2.0
   - Clang 19.1.7
   - CMake 3.31.6
   - Ninja 1.12.1

   - Open /workspace in the container

## Verification

After installation, verify your setup:
```bash
# Windows
cl.exe /?
cmake --version
ninja --version
vcpkg --version

# Linux/macOS
clang --version
cmake --version
ninja --version
vcpkg --version
```

## Project Structure
All projects in this course follow this basic structure:
```
project/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakeLists.txt
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMakePresets.json
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utilities.ixx (or .h/.cpp for header projects)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vcpkg.json
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
```

## Debugging Setup

To enable debugging in your projects, you'll need to configure a launch.json file in VS Code. The file should point to your project's compiled binary. The default binary paths vary by operating system and compiler. Here are the typical paths (replace "ProjectName" with your actual project name):

- Windows (MSVC): `build/cl/Debug/ProjectName.exe`
- Linux/macOS (Clang): `build/linux-clang/Debug/ProjectName`
- Docker (Clang): `build/linux-clang/Debug/ProjectName`

Detailed instructions for configuring launch.json are provided in the course videos for each project.
